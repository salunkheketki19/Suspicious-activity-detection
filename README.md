# Suspicious-activity-detection
The goal of my final year project was to create a Real-time Suspicious Activity Detection and Recognition in Video using Open Pose Estimation. Our thesis aimed toÂ generate a warning message based on crucial points detected in human movements while bending down, waving, or moving out of the camera's field of view, as well as objects in its video range, like cell phones, paper-chits, and smartwatches in an exam center.
